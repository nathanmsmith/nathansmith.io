I'm Nathan Smith, and I'm a current Computer Science and Engineering student at UCLA.

Before that, I attended high school in the San Francisco Bay Area while developing mobile games for [Infidian](http://www.infidian.com). I also developed a few of my own small projects, including a [mirror app for iOS](https://github.com/nathunsmitty/MirrorPlusPlus) and a [website that determines what you should wear based on the weather](http://shouldiwearpants.today).

I'm currently available for consulting with iOS or web development through my business, [Smith Industries](http://smith.industries). You can find me most places with the username @nathunsmitty.
