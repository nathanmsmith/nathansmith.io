Hi, I'm Nathan.

I'm a student at [UCLA][1] studying Computer Science & Engineering. I currently work at my [school newspaper][2] and my school [radio station][3] as a web developer. You can find out more about my experience through [Github][4] or [Linkedin][5].

Please feel free to [say hi][6][^1]; I love talking to new people!
