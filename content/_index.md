Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a production engineering intern at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com). Iâ€™m senior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu), where Iâ€™m majoring computer science with a minor in digital humanities. I graduate June 2021.

This summer, I was a software engineering intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), where I worked on the backend services that power Terminal. Before that, most of my previous experience was in frontend development, which I did at [Keybase](https://keybase.io), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com).

At school, I led developers and coded websites for my [school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com/) and [radio station](https://uclaradio.com/). Last spring, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for a [course on software development and tooling](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring20/cs97-1/index.html).
