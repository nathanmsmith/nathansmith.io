Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m senior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu), where Iâ€™m majoring in computer science with a minor in digital humanities. I graduate June 2021, and will then be joining [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as a full-time software engineer based in Seattle.

My interests include data visualization, functional programming, developer tooling, and full stack development. I've previously worked at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Keybase](https://keybase.io), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com).

At UCLA, I led developers and coded websites for my [school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com/) and [radio station](https://uclaradio.com/). Last spring, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for a [course on software development and tooling](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring20/cs97-1/index.html).
