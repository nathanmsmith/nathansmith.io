Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who works on [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas). I recently graduated from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) with a major in computer science with a minor in digital humanities.

My interests include data visualization, functional programming, developer tooling, and full stack development. I've previously interned at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Keybase](https://keybase.io), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com).

In my free time, I maintain [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io/), a website that provides real-time enrollment statistics, grade distributions, and professor reviews for all UCLA courses.

On this site, you can:

- skim my [blog posts](/posts)
- view my [portfolio](/portfolio)
- read my [rÃ©sumÃ©](/resume.pdf)

Feel free to also explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/nathunsmitty) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmatthewsmith/).

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:hi@nathansmith.io). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).
