Exploring Enrollment was my Digital Humanities independent study project, conducted during UCLA's 2020 winter quarter and advised by professor [Ashley Sanders Garcia](https://asandersgarcia.humspace.ucla.edu). I wrote a set of web scrapers that pulled enrollment data from thousands of UCLA courses over the course of 6 months. Exploring Enrollment was the analysis of that data.

Course enrollment data continues to fascinate me; I've continued the work from Exploring Enrollment on to [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io).
