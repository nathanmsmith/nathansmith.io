My friend Tim invited me to help host a workshop on Vim. It ended up turning out to be a pretty great introduction to Vim! In addition, you can check out our [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18uT1lDsl_skBRmyLN9IVe2q-f7ZvldmKtJcY7KuMDfI/edit?usp=sharing) and [README writeup](https://github.com/uclaacm/hack-tooling-series/tree/master/session-1-vim).
