I interned for Keybase after my sophmore year at UCLA. While there I worked on Keybase's open-source mobile and desktop client applications, written in React and utilizing Electron and React Native. During my time, I refactored and tested notification badging icons across 10+ interface pages on both the desktop and mobile applications, integrated server data into the client through Redux in order to provide more accurate information on unread chat messages, and implement major screens for Keybase's [integration with the Stellar cryptocurrency](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar-launch).

I'm currently doing my second internship at Keybase! The work I'm doing now is a lot more full-stack oriented, and is focused specifically on even tighter Stellar integration. Expect updates in a few months.

Since the Keybase client is open source, you can see all of the work I did [on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/client/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+author%3Anathunsmitty).
