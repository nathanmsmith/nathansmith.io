Hi, I'm Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) studying Computer Science & Engineering. This summer, I'm interning at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com), where I'm working on internal website development. Back at UCLA, I help run the online department of our [school newspaper](http://dailybruin.com) as well as co-manage the web department of our [school radio station](https://uclaradio.com). Interested in the details? Feel free to peruse my [portfolio](/portfolio), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmatthewsmith), or [Github](https://github.com/nathunsmitty).

When I'm not writing code for computers, I enjoy writing words for humans, and occasionally post thoughts [here](/posts).

Please feel free to [say hi](mailto:{{ site.author.email }})[^keybase]; I love talking to new people!
