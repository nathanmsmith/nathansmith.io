Hi, I'm **Nathan**.

I'm a student at [UCLA][1] studying Computer Science & Engineering. I currently work at my [school newspaper][2] and my [school radio station][3] as a web developer. If youâ€™re interested more in what I do, you can check out my [Github][4] or [Linkedin][5].

Please feel free to [say hi][6][^1]; I love talking to new people!
