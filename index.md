Hi, I'm Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) studying Computer Science. This
past summer, I interned at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com), where I worked
on developing and designing an internal website to connect engineers within the
company. When I'm not studying for class, I help run the online department of my
[school newspaper](http://dailybruin.com) as well as co-manage the web
department of my [school radio station](https://uclaradio.com).[^studentmedia]
Interested in the details? Feel free to peruse my [portfolio](/portfolio),
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmatthewsmith),
[Github](https://github.com/nathunsmitty), or [rÃ©sumÃ©](/resume.pdf).

When I'm not writing code for computers, I enjoy writing words for humans, and
very infrequently post thoughts [here](/posts).

Please feel free to [say hi](mailto:{{ site.author.email }})[^keybase]; I love
talking to new people!

[^studentmedia]: I really like student media.
