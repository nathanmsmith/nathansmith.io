Hi, I'm Nathan.

I'm a student at [UCLA][1] studying Computer Science & Engineering. I currently work at my [school newspaper][2] as a web developer and my [school radio station][3] as a mobile developer. Interested in the details? Feel free to peruse my [portfolio][4], [Linkedin][5], or [Github][6].

I also enjoy writing for humans, and occasionally post [here][7].

Please feel free to [say hi][8][^1]; I love talking to new people!
