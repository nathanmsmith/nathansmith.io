I enjoy building things, especially when those things can be used by anyone to solve problems I've noticed. Here are a few things I've built:

### UCLA Radio: [UCLA Radio for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ucla-radio/id420784130) (October 2016 - Present)

I help to maintain the UCLA Radio iOS app. As an internet-only radio station, the maintenance of UCLA Radio's website and app is vital to it's presence. Most recently, I've been working on localizing show times across timezones and implementing reminder push notifications for specific shows. ([Source](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio-iOS))

### Daily Bruin: [Women's Volleyball Rides the Wave of United Longtime Companionship](http://graphics.dailybruin.com/womens-volleyball-2016/) (November 2016)

My first assignment for the Daily Bruin was to create a custom responsive article to enhance the content of a story on UCLA’s Women’s Volleyball team. The page utilizes [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [parallax.js](http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/). ([Source](https://github.com/daily-bruin/wvolleyball_f16wk6))

### [shouldiwearpants.today](http://shouldiwearpants.today) (September 2016)

Weather, as I’ve learned, is a fickle beast, making hard to always know what to wear. This website attempts to know the answer so you don’t have to.

Shouldiwearpants.today was originally released as a client side javascript application, before I realize a server was necessary to handle some of the more advanced features I wanted to add such as geocoding. The site now runs as a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) application and is hosted with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). ([Source](https://github.com/nathunsmitty/shouldiwearpants.today))

### Mirror++ (December 2015)

A simple mirror app I wrote in a weekend for iOS, using Swift and AVFoundation. As far as I know, it’s the only [non-reversing mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-reversing_mirror) app. I tried to publish it to the app store, but Apple rejected it. The code is open source though and you can compile and run it on your iOS device. ([Source](https://github.com/nathunsmitty/MirrorPlusPlus))
