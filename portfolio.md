I enjoy building things, especially when those things can be used by everyone to solve problems I've had. Here are a few things I've built, both on my own time and for other people:

### UCLA Radio: [uclaradio.com][1] (February 2017 – Present)

In my second quarter of working for UCLA Radio, I began to do some work on our main site. After going through some tutorials on React, I was able to social links to show pages as well as a modal popup notifying listeners about our pledge drive during the month of May. Aside from that, I've written (and rewritten) documentation on getting the uclaradio.com development environment set up, contributing guidelines, and our API documentation. ([Source][2])


### UCLA Radio: [UCLA Radio for iOS][3] (October 2016 – Present)

I help to maintain the UCLA Radio iOS app. As an internet-only radio station, the maintenance of UCLA Radio's website and app is vital to its presence. Most recently, I've been working on localizing show times across timezones and implementing reminder push notifications for specific shows. ([Source][4])

### [lonesierra.com][5] (February 2017)

A small website made for a friend to help promote his music. ([Source][6])

### [Site Tracker](http://sitetracker.nathansmith.io) (January 2017)

A very simple (and still very in progress) utility that periodically checks specified websites for updates and sends emails accordingly. It was created out of a need to know when professors updated their class sites with important information.

### Daily Bruin: [Women's Volleyball Rides the Wave of United Longtime Companionship][7] (November 2016)
![Screenshot of volleyball page][image-2]
My first assignment for the Daily Bruin was to create a custom responsive article to enhance the content of a story on UCLA’s Women’s Volleyball team. The page utilizes [Bootstrap][8] and [parallax.js][9]. ([Source][10])

### [shouldiwearpants.today][11] (September 2016)

Weather, as I’ve learned, is a fickle beast, making hard to always know what to wear. This website attempts to know the answer so you don’t have to.

Shouldiwearpants.today was originally released as a client side javascript application, before I realize a server was necessary to handle some of the more advanced features I wanted to add such as geocoding. The site now runs as a [Flask][12] application and is hosted with [Heroku][13]. ([Source][14])

### Mirror++ (December 2015)
![Mirror++ app icon][image-4]
A minimalist mirror app I wrote in a weekend for iOS, using Swift and AVFoundation. As far as I know, it’s the only [non-reversing mirror][15] app. I tried to publish it to the app store, but Apple rejected it. The code is open source though and you can compile and run it on your iOS device. ([Source][16])
