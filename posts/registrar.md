The [Office of the UCLA Registrar](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu) is an entity that's interested me for a while, mainly because of the large amount of data about campus they have. Most of this data isn't publicly accessible and requires a California Public Records Request to be made to the department of [Records Management & Information Practices](https://www.finance.ucla.edu/tax-records/records-management). A few interesting sets of data, however, are hidden away in the Registrar's [Archives page](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Archives).

Of particular interest to me is the archived Schedule of Classes, from 1998 to 2018. On this page is a set of PDFs, each about 100 pages long, of all classes offered during a particular quarter at UCLA. The only problem? They're all PDFs.
