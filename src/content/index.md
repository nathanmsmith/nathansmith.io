Hi, I'm Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising junior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) studying Computer Science and a returning software engineering intern for [Keybase](https://keybase.io) in New York City. Currently, I develop cryptocurrency-related features for Keybase's open-source desktop and mobile applications.

I finished a winter internship earlier this year at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), where I implemented features and improvements to Datadog's suite of data visualizations. I've also previously completed frontend internships at Keybase and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com).

At UCLA, I managed a team of 30 student developers and coded websites for my
[school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com). Prior to that, I led web and mobile development for my [school radio station](https://uclaradio.com).

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).

Feel free to peruse my
[GitHub](https://github.com/nathunsmitty), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmatthewsmith/), [rÃ©sumÃ©](/resume.pdf), or some of the things I've worked on below.
