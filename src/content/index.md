Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a rising junior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) studying Computer Science. I currently work as a software engineering intern for [Keybase](https://keybase.io) in New York City.

I finished a winter internship earlier this year at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), where I implmented features and improvements to Datadog's suite of data visualizations. Last summer, I was also Keybase -- I liked it so much I had to go back! -- where I helped create the frontend of Keybase's desktop and mobile applications. Two summers ago, I interned at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com), where I worked on developing and designing an internal website to connect engineers within the company.

At UCLA, I managed a team of student developers and coded websites for my
[school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com). Prior to that, I led web and mobile development for my [school radio station](https://uclaradio.com).

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).
