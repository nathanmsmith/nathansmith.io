Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m senior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu), where Iâ€™m majoring computer science with a minor in digital humanities. Currently, Iâ€™m a software engineering intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), where I work on the backend services that power Terminal.

Last summer, I was a returning software engineering intern at [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty) in New York City. Iâ€™ve also previously done frontend internships with [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com). In the fall, Iâ€™ll be a production engineering intern at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com).

At school, I led development of and coded websites for my [school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com/) and [radio station](https://uclaradio.com/). Last spring, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for a [course on software development and tooling](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring20/cs97-1/index.html).
