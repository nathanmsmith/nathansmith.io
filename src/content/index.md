Hi, I'm Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) studying Computer Science.

This past summer, I was a returning software engineering intern at [Keybase](https://keybase.io) in New York City, where I developed cryptocurrency-related features for Keybase's open-source desktop and mobile applications, as well as implemented functionality for Keybase's bot APIs.

I finished a winter internship earlier this year at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), where I implemented features and improvements to Datadog's suite of data visualizations. I've also previously completed frontend internships at Keybase and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com).

At UCLA, I formerly managed a team of 30 student developers and coded websites for my
[school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com). Prior to that, I led web and mobile development for my [school radio station](https://uclaradio.com). Nowadays, I usually spend my free time bouldering, reading, or hacking on the odd side-project.

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).

Feel free to peruse my
