Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a software engineering intern on the Data Visualization team at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) in New York City.

I'm halfway through a Computer Science degree at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu). I'll be returning to school in Semptember 2019, and expect to graduate in June 2021.

Last summer, I
worked as a software engineering intern for
[Keybase](https://keybase.io), where I helped develop Keybase's
open-source desktop and mobile applications. I'll be returning to Keybase for another internship in June 2019. I also previously interned for [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com), where I worked
on developing and designing an internal website to connect engineers within the
company.

In my spare time, I lead the online department of my
[school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com). I formerly led web and mobile development for my
[school radio station](https://uclaradio.com). I still contribute code and DJ
shows on occaision.

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).
