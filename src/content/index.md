Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m senior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu), where Iâ€™m majoring computer science with a minor in digital humanities. Currently, I'm between jobs -- I'll be starting as a production engineering intern at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) in a couple weeks.

This summer, I was a software engineering intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), where I worked on the backend services that power Terminal. Before that, most of my previous experience was in frontend development, which I did at [Keybase](https://keybase.io), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com).

At school, I led developers and coded websites for my [school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com/) and [radio station](https://uclaradio.com/). Last spring, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for a [course on software development and tooling](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring20/cs97-1/index.html).

On this site, you can read my [blog](/posts) or browse my portfolio below. Feel free to also explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/nathunsmitty), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmatthewsmith/), or [rÃ©sumÃ©](/resume.pdf).
