Hi, I'm Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a software engineering intern at [Stripe](https://stripe.com). My interests include telling stories through data, functional programming languages, and improving developer workflows through tooling.

In the fall, I'll be a production engineering intern at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com). I'm going into my last year at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) next winter, where I am majoring [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu) with a minor in [Digital Humanities](https://dh.ucla.edu). I'll graduate in June 2021.

Last summer, I was a returning software engineering intern at [Keybase](https://keybase.io) in New York City, where I primarily worked on auto-generating types for Keybase's bot libraries. I've also previously done frontend internships with [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) and [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com).

At UCLA, I was a [Learning Assistant](https://ceils.ucla.edu/learningassistants/) for [CS 97: Software Construction Projects](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring20/cs97-1/index.html). I also formerly managed a team of 30 student developers and coded websites for my [school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com). Prior to that, I led web and mobile development for my [school radio station](https://uclaradio.com). I've since traded in my student media career for a lot more free time, but I stay involved as a member of the [publishing board](http://uclacommunicationsboard.org) for all student media at UCLA.

I usually spend my free time bouldering, reading, or hacking on the odd side-project. I occasionally [write](/posts) about my technical adventures.

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).
