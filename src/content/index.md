Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a rising junior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu), where I study computer science.

I recently finished a winter internship with the data visualization team at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) in New York City. I'll be returning to New York in a few weeks for a summer internship at [Keybase](https://keybase.io).

Last summer, I worked as a software engineering intern for Keybase, where I contributed code to their open-source desktop and mobile applications. I also previously interned for [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com), where I worked
on developing and designing an internal website to connect engineers within the
company.

At UCLA, I managed a team of student developers and coded websites for the Online section of my
[school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com). Prior to that, I led web and mobile development for my
[school radio station](https://uclaradio.com).

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).

Feel free to peruse my
