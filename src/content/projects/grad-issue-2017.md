Traditionally, the Daily Bruin's Graduation Issue is written by next year's incoming staff. As an incoming Assistant Online Editor, I worked with my other Online Editors to create a digital homepage for the last Daily Bruin issue of the 2016â€“2017 school year. During the tight deadline, I learned a lot about npm build scripts, Javascript templating engines, CSS post-processors, and just how little sleep on I could run on.

In 2018, the site [won first place](https://dailybruin.com/2018/04/28/the-daily-bruin-takes-home-multiple-first-place-awards-at-spj-conference/) for "Best Use of Multimedia" from the Society of Professional Journalists Region 11.
