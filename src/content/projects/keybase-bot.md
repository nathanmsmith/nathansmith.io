After my summer 2018 internship with Keybase, I decided to stick around doing some part time work with them! This project can essentially be described as a Node.js wrapper around the Keybase JSON API, intended for users to create applications and bots with the Keybase service.

What I did during my few months of working on the Keybase Bot:

- Set up both development and build tooling
- Implement support for "oneshot" logins with a user's paperkey
- Rearchitect the internals of the bot, using a mix of object-oriented and functional ideas to get a nice blend of an easy to understand and use external API, managable internal code, and atomic, testable functions.
- Extend the bot's chat functionality by adding support for sending and receiving attachments and emoji reactions.
- Implement Keybase wallet support, allowing users to send and request Stellar lumens.

I had a lot of fun working on this project and ended up learning a lot about managing processes, files, and API design. The code for the bot is open-source and available on GitHub; you can all view [a list of all of my contributions](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-bot/commits?author=nathunsmitty) there as well.
