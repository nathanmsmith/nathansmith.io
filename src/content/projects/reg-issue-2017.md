Registration Issue is the Daily Bruin's first issue of the new school year. Similar to our work for Graduation Issue, I and my other Online editors created a centerpiece page to showcase all of the content written by the Bruin's staff. We also took this oppurtunity to create a tooling template for DB Online static projects.
