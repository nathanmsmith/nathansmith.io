UCLA Radio has been an internet-only radio station since 1999, which means that for all of our listeners without the iOS app, the web site is the only way to listen to UCLA Radio. It also tends to be a site that users tend to stay on for hours, as they listen to their favorite shows.

I started working on UCLA Radio's website in Janurary 2017, and began leading development of the site in April 2017. Features I've implemented include social links on every show page as well as a modal popup notifying listeners about our pledge drive during the month of May. As co-manager of UCLA Radio's web department, I brought good software engineering practices to our site by way of establishing a linter configuration, improving our build process, automating our builds with continuous integration and deployment, writing documentation and contributing guidelines, and supporting development on Windows platforms.
