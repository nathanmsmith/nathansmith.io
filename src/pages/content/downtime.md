# Downtime

Since November 30, 2018, I've been practicing a habit I call downtime. The idea of downtime is just that: specifically scheduled time in my day for me to take a break, clean, ensure that my life is in order, and whatever else I think needs to be done that I wouldn't otherwise have time to do in my scheduled time.

Usually, my downtime follows the following format:

1. Physically clean
   1. Bedroom
   1. Desk
   1. Kitchen
   1. Bathroom
1. Organize To-dos. I try to follow a general Getting Things Done methodology.

   1. Clean out any inboxes. This means checking the the following places:

      1. Email
      1. Physical mail
      1. Unread messages
         - [iMessage](imessage://)
         - Keybase
         - [Slack](slack://)
         - [Facebook messenger](https://www.messenger.com)
      1. Paper tray inbox
      1. [Things inbox](things:///show?id=inbox)

   2. For each item found in an inbox, determine if it is actionable or not.

      - If it is not,
        - discard/trash/recycle it
        - archive it for later recall
        - incubate it if it is a possible later action
      - If it is, determine the next **physical and visible action** that needs to be done.

   3. For each physical and visible action,
      - if it will take less than 2 minutes to do, do it.
      - if it requires a next action from someone else, defer it. Ask that person, [create a task in Things with the "waiting for" tag](things:///add?tags=waiting%20for).
      - if it needs to be done at a certain time, [add it to your calendar](x-fantastical://parse).
      - if it should be done by you, [create an action](things:///add) in Things. If it part of a larger project, [create a new project](things:///add-project?) in Things. If the item is assignable to an area, assign it.

1. Organize calendars.

   - Review the events for the rest of the current day and the next day.
     - Remove any events that you will not go to.
     - Reschedule events if needed.
     - Ensure that there are reminders for any events that are not regularly repeated. Select reasonable remind times.
     - Ensure that there is enough travel time between events.
   - Review your Things activities on both the [Today](things:///show?id=today) and [Anytime](things:///show?id=anytime) list. Schedule blocks of time to do these activities on your calendar.
