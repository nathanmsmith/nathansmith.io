Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a junior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) studying Computer Science.

This past summer, I
worked as a software engineering intern for
[Keybase](https://keybase.io) in New York City, where I helped develop Keybase's
open-source desktop and mobile applications. The summer before that, I interned for [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com), where I worked
on developing and designing an internal website to connect engineers within the
company.

Back in Los Angeles, I lead the online department of my
[school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com) when Iâ€™m not studying. I also curate
and create blog content for UCLAâ€™s largest student-run
[computer science organization](http://www.uclaacm.com). I formerly led web and mobile development for my
[school radio station](https://uclaradio.com). I still contribute code and DJ
shows on occaision.

The best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).
