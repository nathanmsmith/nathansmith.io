I interned for Keybase after my sophmore year at UCLA. While there I worked on Keybase's open-source mobile and desktop client applications, written in React and utilizing Electron and React Native. During my time, I refactored and tested notification badging icons across 10+ interface pages on both the desktop and mobile applications, integrated server data into the client through Redux in order to provide more accurate information on unread chat messages, and implement major screens for Keybase's [upcoming integration with the Stellar cryptocurrency](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar).

Since the Keybase client is open source, you can see all of the work I did [on GitHub](https://github.com/keybase/client/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+author%3Anathunsmitty).
