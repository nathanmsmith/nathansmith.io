Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a rising junior at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu) studying Computer Science. I'm currently a software engineering intern for [Keybase](https://keybase.io) in New York City, where I help develop Keybase's open-source desktop and mobile applications.

Last summer, I interned for [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com), where I worked on developing and designing an internal website to connect engineers within the company.

Back in Los Angeles, I lead the online department of my [school newspaper](https://dailybruin.com) when Iâ€™m not studying. I also curate and create blog content for UCLAâ€™s largest student-run [computer science organization](http://www.uclaacm.com).

I formerly led web and mobile development for my [school radio station](https://uclaradio.com). I still contribute code and DJ shows on occaision.

If you're interested in details, feel free to peruse my [GitHub](https://github.com/nathunsmitty), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanmatthewsmith/), or [rÃ©sumÃ©](/resume.pdf). You can also contact me via [email](mailto:nathan.smith@ucla.edu). For additional security, you can find my public key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nathunsmitty).

When Iâ€™m not writing code for computers, I enjoy board games, visiting museums, and eggo waffles.
